<h1>Welcome to my E-Portfolio!</h1>

<article>
        <h2 id="About">About Me</h2>
    <h4>Here's some basic information about me.</h4>
    <img src="assets/me.png" height="386" width="290" alt="A picture of me">
    <p>My name is Matthew Maxwell and this is my E-Portfolio. My first degree is a B.A. Communication and Rhetoric from University of Colorado Denver. 
    I knew I always wanted to go back to school or learn more about computer science because it's always been a favorite area of mine because of 
    how wide spread computers are but first, I was an introvert with anxiety problems, the Communication degree has helped a great deal with that 
    and I think it's made me more rounded person for it. If I'm not doing programming I'm more than likely reading (SciFi rocks!) or playing a video game.
    I am currently working on my second Bachelors, this time in Computer Science, specifically programming. I'll talk more about that further down the page.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>My current goals are to graduate with an Associate of Comp. Sci. before moving on to a B.S. Comp. Sci with a focus on programming. Ideally, I want to end up somewhere
    like Microsoft or brave my way into game development because that is an area I find fascinating and something that I think would be fun and provide a lot of experience because
    of all of the moving parts that are involved. But for the most part I am happy to learn whatever language fits the project best.</p>

<article id="Program">
        <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>Here are the languages that I know and am comfortable with.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="cpp.html">C++</a></li>
        <li><a href="csharp.html">C#</a></li>
        <li><a href="java.html">Java</a></li>
        <li><a href="javascript.html">JavaScript</a></li>
        <li>Python</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most of the time I will be tinkering around in my spare time trying to do something fun.<br>
    <p>I want to branch out in more depth into Python, C#, and SQL. As well as more mobile development in Java or Kotlin for Android.</p>

<article id="html">
        <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>While I am not exactly a web person, I know enough to build a functioning website and will be taking server side scripting. Below is some examples
    of stuff I have worked on as well as this webpage that you're on right now.</p>
